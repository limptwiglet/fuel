# fuel

fuel is a ember.js build/setup tool written in node.js to help you manage your ember applications.

You can use fuel to:
* Create application structure
* Build and compress your application code
* Setup a development server

fuel is in a very early stage, infact it dosnt do much at all at the moment. But it is coming and is being spured on by a personal project that needs such a build tool.
